   "description": "Robots rushing after football to scores goals against each other! Look there. Battle of Bots. Sparks coming from the clashes of their metal bodies. And the sounds from above? The drones. Machines in the factories, self-driving cars, surgical operation robots - that's the future of technology. Technology is advancing like never before, and as humans, it is up to all of us to make sure we are not left behind. Humans are superior to machines. They always were. They always will be.
